// Inheritance: Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
// There are there four types of inheritance
/*  1. Single level. (Dad & son)
 *  2. Multi level.  (Grand father, Dad & son)
 *  3. Hierarchical.  (Father, Son & Daughter)
 *  4. Hierarchical.  (Its combination of all types)
