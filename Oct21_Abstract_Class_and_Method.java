//An abstract class is declared using the abstract keyword. It serves as a blueprint for other classes. 
//Hereâ€™s how you define an abstract class:
abstract class Vechical {
//An abstract method does not have a body. 
//It is declared in an abstract class, and subclasses must provide their own implementation for this method.
   abstract void speed();
